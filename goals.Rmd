### Machine Learning to Promote Collective Citizen Capacity

Generate

 - a dynamic representation of presidentially-relevant news
 - but also, research questions 
 - and hands-on educational experiences  

Some inspirations

 - polling aggregation, as epitomized by site's like Nate Silver's 538
 - distant reading, not studying the news, but consuming a greater quantity of news via machine reading

Why this makese sense in my continually evolving understanding of libraries

 - The vanguard of democratizing information by lowering barriers to access
 - Connected to expansion from information access to information use
 - Alignment with [core library values](http://www.ala.org/advocacy/intfreedom/corevalues): promoting equal information access and use, enabling democratic governance, and contributing to the public good.

* Alorithmia provides algorithms that could piece something like this together, [for example](https://blog.algorithmia.com/create-your-own-machine-learning-powered-rss/)
* Lexis-Nexis acquired Moreover who provided media monitoring and news aggregation, now [Newsdesk](https://www.lexisnexis.com/en-us/products/newsdesk.page); less sure what it provides now
* [AlchemyAPI](https://github.com/AlchemyAPI) acquird by IBM; Alchemy DataNews is now [Watson Discovery News](https://www.ibm.com/watson/services/discovery-news/); given search term, returns top stories with links, entities (topics, people), sentiment (and sentient by source domain), anomalies (days with unusually high mentions), co-mentioned entities (and sentiment of co-mentions). 

Academic- or public-oriented

* [Vanderbilt TV News archive](https://tvnews.vanderbilt.edu/): newscasts from ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN and Fox News; searchable database of abstracts at story level, but transcripts or story features not provided. Stories are manually abstracted (and segmented?).
* [Internet Archive's TV News archive](https://archive.org/details/tv): search closed-caption transcripts, shows/clips (and transcripts?) divided into 60 second segments; included sources are clearly identified. In February 2018, expressed interest in working with researchers interested in ["non-consumptive analysis of television at scale."](https://blog.archive.org/2018/02/22/expanding-the-television-archive/) -- a possibility?
* [GDELT Summary Television Explorer](https://api.gdeltproject.org/api/v2/summary/summary?DATASET=IATV&TYPE=SUMMARY&STARTDATETIME=&ENDDATETIME=): working with TV news archive. Returns summary of appearance of query term -- volume (based on 15 second blocks, percent of blocks in which search term appears), by station, wordcloud, and top clips. [`newsflash`](https://github.com/hrbrmstr/newsflash) is R package for interacting with IA/GDELT
* [GDELT (broadly)](https://www.gdeltproject.org/): "monitors the world's broadcast, print, and web news from nearly every corner of every country in over 100 languages" -- an expansion of global event data system (started with sample of Summary of World Broadcasts)
* [UCLA communication archive](https://tvnews.sscnet.ucla.edu/public/): can enter search term (and date), returns clips and ability to facet by network.
* [Newsreader](http://www.newsreader-project.eu/news-events/news/) project: also event data focused
