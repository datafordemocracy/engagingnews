# Leads to

## Two inspirations

 - polling aggregation, as epitomized by site's like Nate Silver's 538
 - distant reading: not studying the news, but consuming a greater quantity of news via machine reading

## Larger Goal: Machine Learning to Promote Collective Citizen Capacity
 - a dynamic representation of presidentially-relevant news
 - but also, research questions 
 - and hands-on educational experiences  

## Why this makese sense in my continually evolving understanding of libraries

 - Libraries have been the vanguard of democratizing information by lowering barriers to access. The Library, in partnership with domain experts, is an ideal environment for re- searching and developing tools and methods to help citizens at large better use political information and lower the cost of political attentiveness. Aligned with core library values: promoting equal information access and use, enabling democratic governance, and contributing to the public good.
