# Where are we?

## Acquired with initial exploration

  - articles from the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Washington Post (1/20/17 through 2/28/18) -- thank you Lexis-Nexis and Factiva!
  - formal presidential statements from the [Daily Compilation of Presidential Documents](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/browse/collection.action?collectionCode=CPD) (1/20/17 through 2/28/18)
  - informal presidential communication via the [Trump Twitter archive](http://www.trumptwitterarchive.com/) (1/20/17 through 3/31/18)

## Acquired

  - transcripts scraped from three top-rated news-oriented shows on each of CNN, Fox, MSNBC (1/20/17 through 2/28/18)
  - still working on story segmentation to chunk out the "stories" about Trump/presidency

## Not even begun

  - sampling of top digital news sources (e.g., BuzzFeed, Breitbart, Politico, Vox, [???](http://www.journalism.org/2017/06/01/state-of-the-news-media-methodology/))

Not about having **everything** or a massive set of sources, but representing a range of sources, significant for their own reasons (audience share, history, influence).

## iterate

## also, do social science
