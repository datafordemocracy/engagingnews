# Where are we?

## Acquired with initial exploration

  - articles from the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Washington Post (January 20, 2017 to February 28, 2018)
  - formal presidential statements from the Daily Compilation of Presidential Documents (January 20, 2017 through February 28, 2018)
  - informal presidential communication via the Trump Twitter archive (January 20, 2017 through March 31, 2018)

## Acquired

  - transcripts from three top-rated news-oriented shows on each of CNN, Fox, MSNBC (January 20, 2017 through February 28, 2018)
  - still working on story segmentation to chunk out the "stories" about Trump/presidency

## Not even begun

  - sampling of top digital news sources (e.g., BuzzFeed, Breitbart, Politico, Vox)

Not about having **everything** or a massive set of sources, but representing a range of sources, significant for their own reasons (audience share, history, influence).

# What's next?

The fun part!

 - from diverse sources
 - derived from theories of presidential/political accountability

## represent

 - visually
 - dynamically
 - comparatively
 
## validate

 - experiments on how citizens "read" different features
 
## iterate

 - while adding news each month (or so)
 
## And straight up social science

 - polarization
 - agenda setting
 - accountability
