### So where are we?

 - Acquired with initial exploration
  - articles from the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Washington Post (January 20, 2017 to February 28, 2018)
  - formal presidential statements from the Daily Compilation of Presidential Documents (January 20, 2017 through February 28, 2018)
  - informal presidential communication via the Trump Twitter archive (January 20, 2017 through March 31, 2018)

 - Acquired
  - transcripts from three top-rated news-oriented shows on each of CNN, Fox, MSNBC (January 20, 2017 through February 28, 2018)
  - still working on story segmentation to chunk out the "stories" about Trump/presidency

 - Not even begun
  - sampling of top digital news sources (e.g., BuzzFeed, Breitbart, Politico, Vox)

Not about having **everything** or a massive set of sources, but representing a range of sources, significant for their own reasons (audience share, history, influence).
 
 
### What's next?

The fun part!

 - extract common features from diverse sources 
 - derived from theories of presidential/political accountability (e.g., complexity, tone/affect, keywords, topics, moral language, issue/policy attention, ideological position, named entities, and presidential events (e.g., agent-verb-object).)
 - represent features visually, dynamically, comparatively (openly, reproducibly)
 - experimentally validate how citizens "read" this information
 - iterate
 - plus, straight up social science on polarization, agenda-setting, etc. in media ecosystem

## Some exploration for fun

 - readability, sentiment
 - topics, keyword comparisons
 
## CONVERSATION
