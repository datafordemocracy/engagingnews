### Linky literature

Political scientists, communication scholars, journalists, and others have spent considerable ink enumerating the shortfalls of citizens...

 - selective attention
 - limited civic capacity
 - distaste for politics

The proliferation of information sources and channels has amplified the challenges

 - information filter bubbles/echo chambers
 - information overload
 - distrust of media and uncertainty about new sources
 - uninformed, misinformed, disinformed
 
This is bad 

 - declining attention exacerbates political (and thus economic and social) inequalities...
 - leaders (already) attend primarily to the preferences of the affluent and elite...
 - unequal information will make this so much worse...
 
### There must be a better way

 - to engage political news, 
 - to monitor the activities and attentions of government from a relatively high level, 
 - to encourage the consumption of information from multiple and varied sources
 - to lower the barriers to attentive citizenship in ways that reduce inequalities in time, education, and access.
